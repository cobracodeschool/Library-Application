# My-Library
I utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React JS to construct a library application with information on 240 volumes. I then utilized API to acquire book data. We can add the books to your list of favorite books, and it's entirely front end. 

Beginning with "what" and "why," 

What is web-based library system?
    A Web-based Library Management Software on Cloud controls all the library operations in a systematic way from a single point of access. It helps in keeping records of all the library resources like books, catalogs, journals, e-books, CDs, newspapers, etc.

Why a web application is suitable for a library management system?
    Why choose a web-based library system? A web-based system is more convenient than traditional desktop applications. Users can easily access the cloud or web-based application from anywhere at any time. It is also cost-effective solutions to manage burdensome library operations.
